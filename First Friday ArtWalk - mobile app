This mobile app can be a simple as a google map with a line then webviewing the map page into a mobile app.

App should display info from http://lanearts.org/first-friday-artwalk


Pros:
* So CHEEEAAAAPP
* Bare matianence. Just update the line on the map. NOTHING else.
* No updates needed when changes are made to the route.
* Map changes go everywhere at once. Offer a widget (iframe) for sites?
* SOOOOOO CHEEEEAAAAPP

Cons:
* Limited interaction. It just presents the information.

Development:
Map can be made at MIT app inventor. Takes like 2 min.
Sign up for google account and make line. Takes 5 min if you don't know where that option is.
Get poeple to use it.
